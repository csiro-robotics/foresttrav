# Navigation in Vegetated environments (NVE)


NVE is a mono repo for the for traverasbilit estimation (TE) using 3D probalistic voxels. 

# Overview

This workspace depends on ros noetic and combines functionally the packages required to enable navigation in vegetated environments

The primary target is ROS noetic on Unbuntu 20.04, am64 and used CUDA > 11.7.nvidia/cuda:11.7.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu20.04  

The pakcages are managed using vcs-tools. We avoid the use of submodules on purpose for this repo.
