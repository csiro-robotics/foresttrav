# Layers (see AcclivityMap::add*)
#   input (each layer also exists with a _{source id} suffix for the resampled
#          data):
#     is_level_transition: 1.0 iff this cell might be on the edge of a
#                          transition to a different ground level else 0.0
#     is_real: 1.0 iff real observed surface else 0.0
#     is_temporary: does this cell represent a temporary entity?
#     normal_z: z component of surface normal unit vector
#     penalty: penalty of intersecting cell
#     samples: the number of samples that the normal is based on
#     source: the source of the data (NaN=none, 0=OHM/Heightmap,
#                                     1=Fabio/DensePointClod2/LayeredCostmap)
#     z: z height of each cell or NaN for unknown cells
#   derived:
#     is_fatal: does this cell represent a fatal obstacle that should
#               not be touched by this ground vehicle?
#     is_in_obstacle: does this cell intersect a obstacle that should not be
#                     touched?
